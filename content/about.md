I am a PhD Student in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics @ Sapienza University of Rome, enrolled at the Italian Nation Doctorate in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests involve all those disciplines that combine Robotics and Semantics such as Scene Understanding, 3D Scene Graphs and Task Planning, topic that I have been working on with Prof. Daniele Nardi. 
I have also performed a visiting research period at Mila - Quebec AI Institute during my last year of PhD, during which I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Liam Paull and the REAL Lab of Université de Montréal on related topics to my research,

Before my PhD journey, I graduated Magna cum Laude and Excellence at the Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence & Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome. For my achievements, I was additional awarded as Outstanding Graduate of A.Y. 2021/2022, resulting in the top 2% of all Sapienza graduates of that year.

I also graduated Magna cum Lauda at the Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering at University of Naples "Federico II", but I decided to continue my study path in Rome to fully immerse in the world of AI.
